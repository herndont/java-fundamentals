#Lab01 Java Primitives and Control Flow

#Feature Tasks
    Pluralize: This task was to write a function called pluralize which takes in a word and a number and returns a
    string with the word pluralized if the number was over or under the value of 1.
    #Completed
        I completed this task by using if statements that said the that if the number of animals was higher than one or
        less than 1 the animal type string had an 's' added to it to make it plural.

    Flipping Coins: This task required me to write a function that took in an integer and flipped coins until a
    specified number of coins were flipped to heads. Coin flips were simulated by a random number between 1 and 0.
    Anything over .5 was a heads and under was a tails.
    #Completion
        I was not able to complete this task yet, but think that I am close. I am trying to use a do while loop and some
        if statements to complete this.

    Command Line Clock: This tasks requires that you create a method called clock that utilizes the built in
    LocalDateTime object to constantly print out the current time to the console. This should be done on a second by
    second basis.
    #Completion
        I have not completed this task yet. I have not even started this one yet.



    Trouble Areas: Syntax, Editors, and just overall understanding of the new code. This will take some time.
