###Feature Tasks
   ####Weather Data: 
    Use the October Seattle weather data above. Iterate through all of the data to find the min and max values. Use a
    HashSet of type Integer to keep track of all the unique temperatures seen. Finally, iterate from the min temp to the
    max temp and print out any temperature not seen during the month.


    Write testing code for this method, and ensure that it passes.
    
    
    Completed: I completed the Method for this challenge and started on the testing, but did not finish.

   ####Tallying Elections:
    Write a function called tally that accepts a List of Strings representing votes and returns one string to show what 
    got the most votes.
    
    Write testing code for this method, and ensure that it passes.
       
    Completed: I did not complete this challenge, but got a decent start on it.
   
   
   ####File I/O (JavaScript Linter)
    This task requires you to write a methods that reads a JavaScript file with a given Path and prints an error whenever
    it finds a line that does not end in a semi-colon.
    
    You should read.iterate through the file line by line. Print an error message such as "Line 3: Missing Semicolon" if a
    line is missing a semicolon.

    - Do not show an error if the line is empty
    - Do not show an error if the line ends with an operning curly brace {
    - Do not show an error if the line ends with a closing curly brace }
    - Do not show an error if the line contains if or else
   
    Call that method in your main method on the file gates.js
   
    Completed: I was not able to start on this problem yet.
   
Testing File I/O
    
    -Write unit tests for the map methods
    -Use JUnit to write a test for the linter
        You will need to create a JS file that will test eah of these things!
    
    -Test the linter on a file that contains errors
    -Test the linter on a file that contains one error.
    -Test the linter on a file that contains few errors.
    -Test the linter on a file that contains many errors.
    -Test the linter on an empty file.
    
    
   Trouble Areas: Syntax, Editors, and just overall understanding of the new code. This will take some time.
