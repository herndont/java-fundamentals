##Lab02 Lab 02: Arrays, for loops, imports, ArrayLists

###Feature Tasks
   ####Rolling Dice: 
    This task required me to create a method that mimicked the rolling of a six sided die and record all roll outcomes.
    These recorded outcomes then were suppose to come back in the form of an array.
    
    Completed: This task was completed by using a randomizer to give random numbers based on the length of the array,
    which was set by the number of rolls. Then these outcomes were put into the empty array as the values.
     

   ####Contains Duplicates:
    This task required that a method be written to check an array and make return a boolean response if the array 
    contained any elements that were of equal value. I used a for each loop to do this, but have not quite been able to 
    make this one work. 
    
    Completed: This task is not yet complete. I am a little messed up on the returns. I am close so I don't think finishing this one should 
    take too long.


   ####Calculating Averages:
    This task required that a method be written that sums the values of all of the elements within the array and then
    averages the sum and returns the averaged value.
    
    Completed: This task is not yet completed. I think that I am close to having this complete as I have been able to
    get the sum of the array, but am messed up on the returns again and haven't been able to complete the average portion.
    
   ####Array of Arrays:
   I have not started on this one yet.
    
    Trouble Areas: Syntax, Editors, and just overall understanding of the new code. This will take some time.
