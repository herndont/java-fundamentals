##Lab02 Lab 02: Arrays, for loops, imports, ArrayLists

###Feature Tasks
   ####Rolling Dice: 
    This task required me to create a method that mimicked the rolling of a six sided die and record all roll outcomes.
    These recorded outcomes then were suppose to come back in the form of an array.
    
    Completed: This task was completed by using a randomizer to give random numbers based on the length of the array,
    which was set by the number of rolls. Then these outcomes were put into the empty array as the values.
     

   ####Contains Duplicates:
    This task required that a method be written to check an array and make return a boolean response if the array 
    contained any elements that were of equal value. I used a for each loop to do this, but have not quite been able to 
    make this one work. 
    
    Completed: This challenge is now complete and ready for re-submission.


   ####Calculating Averages:
    This task required that a method be written that sums the values of all of the elements within the array and then
    averages the sum and returns the averaged value.
    
    Completed: This challenge is now complete and is ready for re-submission. I used a loop to go throgh and add all 
    values together and then returned the total divided by the array's initial length.
    
   ####Array of Arrays:
    Given an array of arrays calculate the average value for each array and return the array with the lowest average.
    
    Completed: This function took two methods. The first uses two for loops to iterate over the arrays one by one and
    return the averages of each array into a new array named averages. Then I use another method and
     for loop to iterate over the averages array and find the minimum value. I return the averaged value and the indices
     which shows what week that value is the average of.
     
        
    Trouble Areas: Syntax, Editors, and just overall understanding of the new code. This will take some time.
